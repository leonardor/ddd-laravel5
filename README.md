# Domain Driven Design folder structure for Laravel 5

Proof of concept folder structure for implementing Domain Driver Design in Laravel 5.8

# About this project
This is my first attempt to make a folder structure suitable for organizing a
Domain Driven Design project in Laravel 5.8

I do not claim that this is the way to go for such a type of project but this is the
essence that was perfect for me in terms of intelligibility.

This project has some repetitive and obviously unnecessary patterns and lines of code. This is done on purpose for educative goals for everyone with different levels of programming knowledge to understand how this project was thought and how it can grow further.

You should definitely review the diagram in the PDF file to see the ideas behind this project and to better understand the logic it was built on. 

I read about the pros and cons about implementing Domain Driven Design in Laravel on blogs like:

* https://medium.com/@ibrunotome/a-domain-driven-design-ddd-approach-to-the-laravel-framework-18906b3dd473
* https://lorisleiva.com/conciliating-laravel-and-ddd/
* https://oliverlundquist.com/2018/03/20/how-to-setup-ddd-in-laravel-app.html

and tried to implement to the best of my knowledge the things I have learned from my experience as a developer and from Eric Evans's Domain Driven Design Reference - Definitions and Pattern Summaries:
* https://domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DDD_Reference_2015-03.pdf

If you pass by let me know your opinion and feel free to use this as starting point for your own perfect
folder structure.
